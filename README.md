Project Definition:Sustainable Agricultural Practises Database



To kick off this project description we need to first ask ourselves, who are smallholder farmers? They are basically individuals cultivating small plots of land for subsistence use or local markets.
Our group project is on developing a database system for tracking and promoting sustainable farming practices among smallholder farmers. The database system targets certain needs, particularly in the Kenyan context. The main functionality of the database will be targeted at focusing on two major areas:

a)	crop diversification 

b)	soil conservation.

The agricultural sector in the country facing declining soil fertility and low yields with vulnerability to climate change, unsustainable farming methods like monocropping only further degrade the soil and reduce biodiversity. Most smallholder farmers have neither the resources nor knowledge to farm more sustainably, hence maintaining poor productivity on their farms threatens food security and economic stability.


This project responds to SDG 2: Zero Hunger, focusing on no hunger, food security, improved nutrition, and sustainable agriculture. Emphasizing the very important issues of crop diversification and soil conservation contributes to increasing agricultural productivity and ensuring more resilient and sustainable farming systems. It will further contribute toward SDG 13: Climate Action through the promotion of practices that respond positively to climate change-impacting factors such as soil conservation and biodiversity enhancement.


Most of the food production in Kenya comes from the many small-scale farmers who have to struggle with land degradation, unreliable rainfall, and a general lack of resources.


The database system will contribute to overcoming such challenges by providing insights into data-supported decisions for sustainable practice and monitoring of progress toward such goals. This will result in improved food security, reduction of poverty levels, and environmental sustainability in Kenya.

Specific Objectives
Objective 1: Promote Crop Diversification

Support farmers to diversify crops with the view of spreading risk and improving soil health.
Advise on compatible combinations of crops that suit particular conditions.
Objective 2: Enhance Soil Conservation

Monitor and promote practices associated with soil conservation-cover cropping, reduced tillage, composting.
Monitor indicators of soil health and recommend measures to enhance these.
Objective 3: Facilitate Knowledge Sharing

Allow farmers to share in experiences, challenges, and solutions relative to the adoption of sustainable practices.
Provide access to education and expert advice.
Objective 4: Data-Driven Decision Making

Provide farmers with the ability to track practices, yields, and soil health over time.
Reports are generated that will enable farmers to make better data-driven decisions regarding crop selection and best management practices.
Objective 5: Impact and Sustainability

Assess how diversified cropping and soil conservation will add to the productivity of the farm and health of the environment.
Identify success indicators and areas of further improvement.

Incentives: Number of farmers participating in the sustainability programs and rewards for successful implementation
Events Calendar: Notice of workshops, training sessions, and community events
   



Stakeholders


1.	Smallholder Farmers: input and access data on sustainable practices. The system will provide them with insights into crop diversification, soil conservation, and local resources to enhance yields and soil health. Training and support materials in local languages will ensure they can effectively use the database.
2.	Agricultural Extension Officers:  support farmers by sharing knowledge, will use the database as a centralized resource to guide farmers on environmentally sustainable practices suited to Kenya’s climate.


3.	Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs): use the database to gather and analyze data on farming practices and trends. Access to up-to-date information will allow them to better tailor programs and allocate funding where intervention is most needed.

4.	Government Agencies:  committed to sustainable agriculture and food security, will use the database’s real-time data on soil health, crop choices, and resource allocation to inform policies and support farmer-focused initiatives.

5.	Researchers and Academics: use the data to study soil conservation, crop success rates, and the impacts of diverse planting. Their insights can help refine the agricultural advice provided through the database.

6.	Private Sector (Agri-Businesses and Suppliers): use insights on crop trends and regional demands to tailor products for eco-friendly farming, promoting a business environment that supports sustainable practices.


Addressing Stakeholder Needs
•	Accessible Interface: A user-friendly interface with localized language options and mobile compatibility will ensure ease of access.
•	Training and Support: For farmers and extension officers, we’ll offer guides and possibly in-app training modules to ensure they can use the database effectively.
•	Real-Time Data and Analytics: Relevant stakeholders like NGOs, government agencies, and researchers will have access to robust analytics tools, enabling them to visualize trends, track progress, and identify gaps.
•	Security and Privacy: Protecting farmer data is essential. We’ll implement security protocols to ensure that sensitive information remains private, allowing stakeholders to use the database confidently.
