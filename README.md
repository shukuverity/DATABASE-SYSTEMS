Project Definition:Sustainable Agricultural Practises Database
To kick off this project description we need to first ask ourselves, who are smallholder farmers? They are basically individuals cultivating small plots of land for subsistence use or local markets.
Our group project is on developing a database system for tracking and promoting sustainable farming practices among smallholder farmers. The database system targets certain needs, particularly in the Kenyan context. The main functionality of the database will be targeted at focusing on two major areas:
a)	crop diversification 
b)	soil conservation.
The agricultural sector in the country facing declining soil fertility and low yields with vulnerability to climate change, unsustainable farming methods like monocropping only further degrade the soil and reduce biodiversity. Most smallholder farmers have neither the resources nor knowledge to farm more sustainably, hence maintaining poor productivity on their farms threatens food security and economic stability
This project responds to SDG 2: Zero Hunger, focusing on no hunger, food security, improved nutrition, and sustainable agriculture. Emphasizing the very important issues of crop diversification and soil conservation contributes to increasing agricultural productivity and ensuring more resilient and sustainable farming systems. It will further contribute toward SDG 13: Climate Action through the promotion of practices that respond positively to climate change-impacting factors such as soil conservation and biodiversity enhancement.
Most of the food production in Kenya comes from the many small-scale farmers who have to struggle with land degradation, unreliable rainfall, and a general lack of resources. The database system will contribute to overcoming such challenges by providing insights into data-supported decisions for sustainable practice and monitoring of progress toward such goals. This will result in improved food security, reduction of poverty levels, and environmental sustainability in Kenya.
